# Recipe App

## Introduction

This is a repo for a first attempt to build fullstack web app using Django and python. The app is a very basic recipe storage app.

## Functionality
With this app, you can:
- Create a new recipe, as a logged in user
- Read recipes, based on those stored in the database
- Update an existing recipe, as the logged in user who originally created the recipe
- Delete an existing recipe, as the logged in user who originally created the recipe
- Sign up for a new user account
- Login and logout of an existing user account
- View a (very underwhelming) profile page, as a logged in user

## Tools and tech stack
- Python
- Django
- Bootstrap CSS
- Crispy forms (with bootstrap4)

## Get started
1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into the project folder
3. Activate the virtual environment
4. Install the dependancies
5. Start up the server
6. Go explore the app!
